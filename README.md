# Bank-Customer-Churn
We aim to accomplist the following for this study:
1] Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn:
2] Build a prediction model that will perform the following:
Classify if a customer is going to churn or not
Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn
