# Bank-Customer-Churn
We aim to accomplist the following for this study:

1] Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn:

2] Build a prediction model that will perform the following:

Classify if a customer is going to churn or not

Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn
# Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with the bank. Predicting churn can help banks proactively retain customers by identifying those at risk of leaving.
# Data
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains historical information about bank customers, including demographic data, transaction history, and customer interaction records.
# Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
   
Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Data encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Analyzing trends and distributions in the data.Visualizing relationships between features and target variable (churn).Identifying correlations and important features.

4. Model Selection and Training
Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting).Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Training models and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.Performing cross-validation to ensure robustness of the model.Comparing different models and selecting the best-performing one.

6. Deployment
Exporting the trained model for deployment.Setting up an inference pipeline to handle new data and make predictions.Providing recommendations based on model predictions.
